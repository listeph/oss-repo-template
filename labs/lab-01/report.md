## Step 2: Reading Assignments

### How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way Suggestions
1. If the person is asking too broadly about how to complete their development goal, you can send them links to documentation for tools that they can use to get started. That way you encourage them to take initiative to tinker on their own, and come back to ask more specific questions. When I was project manager for an RPI project, this is how I handled beginners that didn't necessarily know how to make the most of existing manuals and web resources.

2. Do your due diligence in answering the question, testing locally for a helpful solution or offering to have them screenshare their issue if applicable. If you have more experience, your tinkering might lead to more avail then a newbie's would. If you figure out a solution, briefly share the process of how you got to the solution and link relevant documentation so that they can improve their independent problem-solving ability. During my internships, I liked to ask people that answered my questions how they were able to find that answer when I was stuck.

3. If you yourself do not know the answer, you can search existing posted questions to see if anyone else has had a similar or related issue. You can tag the people from that post or team to see if they have further insight.

### Free Culture Reflection
After reading this chapter, I was shocked that this happened because it sounds like something that could happen to me or my friends. It reminds me that it's important to think about the implications of what you create. Just because you intend for it to be used with your purpose in mind, you should still talk to others about the ways in which your technology can be abused. It's like how Facebook started out as just a college project to connect students on campus as well. But now it's grown to be the big company it is, and has to take responsibility for its privacy and antitrust violations. Or it reminds me of how Albert Einstein's idealogy was that of a pacifist, and he was not happy that his research was instrumental in facilitating the development of the atomic bomb that would later be used in Hiroshima. Regardless, I don't agree with the RIAA in this situation and unsurprisingly, the justice system is broken when there was no way for Jesse to defend himself without money. I ended up researching what happened to Jesse Jordan afterwards because I felt bad, and I'm glad to see that he ended up raising $12k back on a personal website.

## Step 6: Reflection
I'd like to evaluate Submitty as my open source project. I have already contributed to the project in previous semesters for RCOS, so this will give me more time to focus on feature development or code refactoring rather than on onboarding / setting up my development environment. I also like that it means I'm working on a product that I myself am using daily, so I can think both like a developer and a user! This semester, my plan is to work on improving CSV uploads for course management in the instructor UI. I want to add the ability for instructors to download a snapshot of their course classlist into a CSV form for recordkeeping, as well as add more columns (such as ability to specify rotating sections) in a classlist CSV upload. This introduces more columns to an already large CSV, so I would also like to work on allowing optional column headers on these uploads.
