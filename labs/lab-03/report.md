## Part 1: Documentation

### Wiki Project Idea

Repo Wiki Link: https://github.com/listeph/oss-repo-template/wiki/Project-Idea
   

    I'd like to evaluate Submitty as my open source project. I have already contributed to the project in previous semesters for RCOS, so this will give me more time to focus on feature development or code refactoring rather than on onboarding / setting up my development environment. I also like that it means I'm working on a product that I myself am using daily, so I can think both like a developer and a user!

    This semester, my plan is to work on improving CSV uploads for course management in the instructor UI. The CSV uploads are useful for the updating of course lists using the registrar's data, rather than doing so manually. This issue was inspired because the registrar's cron-scheduled autofeed broke last semester. Professor Cutler (Submitty's project manager) had also proposed adding the ability for instructors to download a snapshot of their course classlist into a CSV form for recordkeeping, as well as adding more columns (such as ability to specify rotating sections) in a classlist CSV upload. This introduces more columns to an already large CSV, so I would also like to work on allowing optional column headers on these uploads. To implement this feature, I will be using Submitty's tech stack which is HTML and Javascript in the frontend, and PHP and SQL in the backend.

    An existing example of an overcrowded CSV upload due to a lack of columns headers would be Webex's batch attendees invite feature. Some columns such as company or address don't need to be filled in, yet they must be included in the uploaded CSV. Having column headers that allow for optional columns would be a more intuitive and clean UI. There is also a loosely-correlated existing functionality within Submitty that allows for bulk upload of exam pdf's. Although the uploaded data is in a different category and not in CSV format, this is relevant to the bulk upload of users to a course because it still takes the uploaded data to modify what's stored database.

    These findings show more contributors than listed on Github, and a few more lines of code. Maybe this has to do with a difference in counting whitespace, or counts overflowing lines as 2 or 1 lines.

    It was very interesting to visualize the timeline of the B7 project's growth and individual contributions through the Gource video.
