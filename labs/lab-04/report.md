# Lab 04 Report - Open Source Licensing

### 1. Creative Commons License

### 2. Four Criteria for Open Source Software
Read [article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

### 3. Why Choose a License?
It's important to choose a license because it clearly defines rules for the use, modification, and distribution of your open source work. Adding the license to your work is what makes it _available_ to others. This will help attract developers to both contribute to your repository and use your code in their own software programs (possibly to create a more marketable product!). On the other hand, having the license also offers you protection to take legal action against those who violate the stated terms and conditions.

### 4. Why Shouldn't You Use a Project With No License
You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because creative work is under exclusive copyright by default. Without a license, the creators have not yet legally made the code available for use, modification, or distribution. A contributer or user of the software will risk copyright infringement, take-downs, and litigation.

### 5. Failure to Follow Open Systems Model
I agree with the article's claim that an open systems model is more successful when there is both open communications standards and open source software. More specifically, this is idea that developers should release early software versions to the public more incrementally (as opposed to releasing only a finalized product). This method allows the project to gain a larger distributed development community for improving the software, and allows incentivized users of the software to be part of the decision-making process in improving the tools they use regularly. I don't think there is a downside to releasing intermediate versions of software and receiving subsequent feedback from users, so I would agree with the author's point. Even within closed-source software, there are agile methodologies where new versions of the product are released every period.


### 6. Linux and GPL License V2
Based on the [DataCenter Knowledge article by Christopher Tozzi](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/08/23/linus-torvalds-early-linux-history-gpl-license-money), the GNU general public license (GPL) has governed the Linux kernel since 1992. Linus Torvalds first created Linux because he wanted to use a UNIX operating system kernel without having to pay for it. Torvalds had originally written his own license, but switched to GPL because it still allowed the original source code to be available to users while dropping a clause from his original license that money cannot be involved. This clause was taken out of context; for instance, some people wanted to distribute copies of Linux at meetings and wanted to recoup the costs. Torvalds decided that as long as the source code remains freely available, allowing the commercial side of Linux didn't hurt. According to [wpbeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/gpl/), the GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 for his own GNU operating system and it gaurantees the users four freedoms: to run the software for any purpose, study and change the source code, share the software with others, and to share modified versions of the software with others. GPL ensures "copyleft", meaning that modified versions of GPL software must gaurantee the same freedoms. All in all, what GPL stood for aligned well with Linux's open source principles.
