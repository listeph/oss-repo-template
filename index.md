# Stephanie Li | Open Source Software - Spring 2022

## About Me
Hi, I'm Steph and I'm from Brooklyn. I'm a senior CS major, and I'm currently pursuing a career in software engineering. In my free time, I love to read, cook (mostly Asian food) and play guitar (pop and blues). Two books I'm currently reading are Exhalation by Ted Chiang (a collection of creative sci-fi short stories) and Born a Crime by Trevor Noah (he's an amazing story teller with such a unique life experience).
