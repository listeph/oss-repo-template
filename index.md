## Bio
Hi, I'm Steph and I'm from Brooklyn. I'm a senior CS major, and I'm currently pursuing a career in software engineering. In my free time, I love to read, cook, and play guitar (pop and blues). 

Two books I'm currently reading are Exhalation by Ted Chiang and Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. Exhalation is a collection of science fiction short stories where Chiang has very interesting takes on popular concepts such as time travel / AI. Born a Crime is interesting to me because of Trevor Noah's unique life experience -- he was born mixed race during the apartheid in South Africa. He's a great storyteller and he also educates the reader about history and race.
