# Stephanie Li | Open Source Software - Spring 2022

## About Me
Hi, I'm Steph and I'm from Brooklyn. I'm a senior CS major at RPI, and I'm currently pursuing a career in software engineering. In my free time, I love to cook (mostly Asian food) and play guitar (pop and blues).

Two books I'm reading right now are Exhalation by Ted Chiang (a collection of sci-fi short stories with creative takes on popular concepts such as time travel and AI) and Born a Crime by Trevor Noah (he's an amazing story teller with a unique life experience having been born mixed race during the apartheid in South Africa).
